\file y_flow_list.c
\brief Business logic / clickflow support.

This file implements flow lists.
A flow list is is a lists of actions (clickflow) that the script will choose from at random, using a set of predetermined weights.
An 'action' is defined as a function that takes no arguments and returns an int - such as an action block, or a function without a specifically defined return type.
\note The weights can be percentages, hit counts, or whatever you like, as long as the total of the weights does not exceed Y_RAND_MAX.

\b Example:
\code
int browse()
{
    y_start_transaction("browse");
    web_link("...", LAST);
    y_end_transaction("", LR_AUTO);
}

buy()
{
    y_start_transaction("buy");
    web_link("...", LAST);
    y_end_transaction("", LR_AUTO);
}

// Define other actions as required.

loadtest_flow()
{
    // Define the weights
    static y_flow flow_list[] = {
        { 0, "action block for browsing the site",  browse,          3700 },   // 37.00%
        { 1, "action block for buying a product",   buy,             2100 },   // 21.00%
        { 2, "action block for checking out",       checkout,         200 },   //  2.00%
        { 3, "function for resetting the database", wipe_database,   2500 },   // 25.00%
        { 4, "end the script for no reason",        lr_abort,        1500 } }; // 15.00%
    const int flow_count = (sizeof flow_list / sizeof flow_list[0]); 

    // Choose a flow to execute
    y_flow *chosen_flow = y_choose_flow(flow_list, flow_count);

    // Change the next transaction number to make sure the numbering stays contiguous.
    // (This is optional. You can use that number for whatever you want, this is just a common use for that field.)
	y_set_next_transaction_nr( y_get_next_transaction_nr() + chosen_flow->number);

    // Execute the chosen flow.
    y_exec_flow(chosen_flow);
}
\endcode
